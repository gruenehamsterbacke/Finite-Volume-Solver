# numerical_toolbox

The aim is to develop a Finite-Volume-Solver.

Milestones:

(1) Implement a class of solvers for linear systems of equations 

(2) Implement a Finite-Volume-Solver for a simple PDEs (steady) for a simple geometry (mesh) 

(3) Implement time-discretization schemes 

(4) Develop a toolbox for mesh generation 

(5) Develop a toolbox for post-processing
