# Finite Volume Solver

The aim is to develop a Finite-Volume-Solver. 

## Roadmap:

(0) Basic tools (like import data files etc.)

(1) Implement a class of solvers for linear systems of equations (later: include LAPACK to efficiently solve the equations)

(2) Implement a Finite-Volume-Solver for a simple PDEs (steady) for a simple geometry (mesh) 

(3) Implement time-discretization schemes 

(4) Develop a toolbox for mesh generation 

(5) Develop a toolbox for post-processing 

(7) Add a graphical interface
